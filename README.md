**Considering sustainabilty in the choices we make is important, but it's often difficult to determine what the more sustainable choices are.** When deciding what to eat, or order, or prepare, there are a lot of factors to consider.  This project specifically examines some of the questions and data concerning how food is transported from a producer to a consumer, and what kind of sustainabilty issues are involved in that transportation.  What kind of transport is used to move the goods?  What kind of fuel does that transport use?  How much fuel is used?  How polluting is that fuel?  How expensive is that fuel?  And, how does transporting food over long distances compare to moving food over short distances in terms of sustainability?  Specifically, this project defines sustainabilty as being efficient in terms of delivery time, fuel consumption, and financial cost, while minimizing CO2 pollution.

### **Motivation**
"Food" is a subject of great interest and passion for me.  Not just in terms of trying new recipies or following foodie-trends, but I am also very curious about the topics of gastro-anthropology, the socio-ethics of food, accessibilty, and sustainability.  

In all the choices that I make in my personal life, especially with my food-related choices, I try to keep sustainability in mind.  Not only in terms of environmental sustainability, but also in terms of financial sustainability. I make a deliberate effort to make the best choices for myself that also minimize the negative effects those choices have on my community and my environment.

I was initially drawn towards this project's specific topic out of a pair of questions that I'd been curious about for a while.  
First, why are the strawberries sold in my grocery store, in the height of strawberry season, imported from California, when I know for a fact that they grow locally.  Is it really so much cheaper to move strawberries in from across the country than it is to bring them in from across town?
And, secondly, with "sustainability" such a hot topic right now (rather than just my own personal goal), why don't I see more of an effort to embrace and advertise sustainability in Nashville's restaurant scene?  There's a few restaurants in town that advertise themselves as sustainable, but not many.  And with Nashville being such a foodie town, and sustainability being such a trendy topic, this makes no sense to me.  

I've read articles about the subject for years, but I've always been curious about what the actual data looks like.  The training and skills I've learned with Nashville Software School, and the opportunity to assemble this project, have given me the chance to finally get to examine and analyze some of this data for myself.
